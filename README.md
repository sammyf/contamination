Contamination

A small godot game simulating the spread of a virus  and the effect of vaccination. The most important parameters can be set before starting the simulation.

In this simulation a vaccine is NOT a perfect defense. It loses its effectivity over time (probably much faster than a real vaccine does, to be honest), but vaccinated units get a booster \
if the effectivity falls below 10%, bringing the defense back to whatever you set it to at the start.

If you want to try other parameters you'll have to stop the game (with ESCAPE) and restart it.

ALSO, important PSA : I'm no doctor, not even remotely in the health industry, so everything in that game is purely out of my backside and shouldn't be used as arguments for ANYTHING, apar\
t for the fact that Godot is an awesome game engine!

Anyway ... Enjoy ... kind of ;)
